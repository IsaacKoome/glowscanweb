now my vision is to create an app where users can instantly get their face analyzed by an AI and they get a personalized recommendation. You see daily when people wake up they go and look at their faces in the mirror and determine what to do like apply some oil near the nose, or there is too much oil in there forehead so they wipe it out.
Another instance I want to build is for women and makeup. Almost every woman carries a mirror in their handbag afer an hour or 2 they open their bag, get their mirror and apply some makeup, refreshen by adding some i don't know oil on their face etc. What if there was an app that would help them be their mirror and advisor as I think hearing another persons opinion isn't a bad thing. The AI could tell them ,'hey, i think here you have added this and this and this, i think you should reduce it and instead add this other product' etc
Very many people struggle with skin conditions of acne, amongst other such skin conditions i see on Reddit app ,they send there questions saying they have asked tonnes of doctors or they have tried a lot of places without help. We could try to help them as AI is becoming more advanced with thousands of trillions of data having been trained on ,maybe the doctor who tried to find the cure for that persons acne hasn't heard of a doctor from another continent who maybe successfully was able to hep diagonise it, that is where our app can come in and tell them ,'hey you could try this and that recommended from a certain doctor or hospital in Japan' ofcourse taking necessary precautions. The AI can keep daily active progress of the persons acne ,see if maybe after a week or 2 it's improving or not. This is my idea app but so far i have created the app and it isn't so good, i haven't even secured my first paying customer yet but I know I will once i bring this app vision to life.
